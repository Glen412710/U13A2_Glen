##### Client Feedback

Client 1 ( Darius )

 layout for the home is very good because some noodles of the actual company that would be presenting the title is big and showing which is very good it in my opinion the nut back is simple but I catch you have some which is the main page phones which has an arrow down which you can change and select which one you want which is very good because if you want a certain phone you don't spend time on the others accessories which has more than one SIM cards phone cases same thing if you want to have one thing rather than gather you very simple but really catching pages and what the company will be about the funds is shine two different types of actual ize a picture of the actual company the SIM card has a link SIM card link on each one of them which make you go to the actual website free or maybe has and this example 120 gigabytes you can actually click on the image and it will actually go on the website itself so that's actually a very good actual website itself cages the phone cases are different in every single one of them they're from Samsung Python the same this one is Nokia and nothing so it's Samsung Nokia nothing it's a company called nothing and Apple which if you want to choose one it's not you have to go through a lot of things you just click on it which is very very good thing is Samsung Nokia nothing and Apple which is you cases have a Napoli which if you click on the picture of actually go on the website last the screen protectors universal because of something Nokia nothing and apple but same thing here you just the actual website is a very good one this simple it's not complicated as well it's like eye-catching on the main page it says this this will be on Apple Samsung the things that you contact us the contact us you can be your phone or your very simple title another title the heading over if you like the contact us on it which is a very straight message you can write your full name which is basically the main thing that you want to do you can choose the phone or the email which if you choose the phone you get the phone number yours obviously you can be your email address after you do that you it says here container box how can we help so in this box it's very straight because you can write your own message if you don't like something or if you need help with this you put your phone number and I want this phone but this one is not available blah so that's that very angry if you submit it will actually say thank you for your agree which is not that simple it's not the same Bluetooth to think about it moves company it will not do that's it thank you.

The recorded message from one of the students on my level group. There are some sentences that do not make sense because its have been incorrectly recorded and slow. The information that has been recorded does not say that i need to make any improvements or changes to my website.

With this feedback i had made a few changes on the about us page to have more and proper information about the company on what i think about of the local company.

The reason for this change because I only have a bit information about the company and with a lot of lorem underneath it, so I decided to replace the lorem with more proper information about the company.

The next changes i had made was the pictures for the phone version was not centered.

The reason for this change because the pictures for phone was off centered and out of place so I decided to center by using grid tutorials on how to use rows, columns & @media.

#### color scheme

The colors will have:

\# Not a title

Design  A:
\#O5445E - Navy Blue
\#189AB4 - Blue Grotto
\#75E6DA - Blue Green
\#D4F1F4 - Baby Blue

Design  B:
\#F4F4F4 - White Smoke
\#3575D4 - Windows Blue
\#4991FD - Dark Sky Blue

The reason with i have chosen blue is because its more calming, inspire of being trustworthy and having reliability. For A and B.
it draws people showing that the company is confident on selling phones.

#### fonts 

I am using AirStrike font from dafont for my title because it can attracts people's attention.

I am using Coolvetica font from dafont for my main text for my website because it will make it more readable for the users.
