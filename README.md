with the Blue colour will be the ones that the ursers can interact with.


##### Client Feedback

The colours will have:

Two types of blue,
-3575D4 dark blue
-4991FD light blue

The darker blue being the most to interact with.

with a white or dark background

Dark background - 525252

The reason with i have chosen blue is because its more carming, inspire of being trustworthy and haveing reliabillity. For A and B.
it drawns people showing that the company is confident on selling phones.
