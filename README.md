##### Client Feedback

Client 1 ( Darius )

The layout of the home page is very good. The title is prominently displayed, which is excellent. The background is simple but eye-catching. There is a dropdown menu on the main page that allows users to select different phones, which is very convenient. Users can quickly find a specific phone without having to scroll through others.

The accessories section includes options for SIM cards and phone cases. Each item has a link that takes you to the relevant website. For example, if a SIM card offers 120 gigabytes, clicking on the image will take you directly to that product's page. This functionality is very useful.

The phone cases are categorized by brand, such as Samsung, Nokia, and Apple. This organization makes it easy for users to find what they need without much hassle. The same applies to screen protectors, which are available for multiple brands.

The overall design is simple yet effective and visually appealing. On the main page, there are sections for different brands, like Apple and Samsung, making navigation straightforward.

The "Contact Us" page is very user-friendly. It has a clear form where users can enter their full name, choose to be contacted by phone or email, and write their message. The message box is straightforward, allowing users to specify their needs or concerns. Once the form is submitted, the website thanks the user, providing a sense of acknowledgment.

In summary, the website is very well-designed. It is simple, not complicated, and visually appealing. The navigation is easy, and the contact form is straightforward and efficient. Well done!

The recorded message from one of the students on my level group. There are some sentences that do not make sense because its have been incorrectly recorded and slow. The information that has been changed to make it more suitable to read, and it does not say that i need to make any improvements or changes to my website.

With this feedback i had made a few changes on the about us page to have more and proper information about the company on what i think about of the local company.

The reason for this change because I only have a bit information about the company and with a lot of lorem underneath it, so I decided to replace the lorem with more proper information about the company.

The next changes i had made was the pictures for the phone version was not centered.

The reason for this change because the pictures for phone was off centered and out of place so I decided to center by using grid tutorials on how to use rows, columns & @media.

#### color scheme

The colors will have:

\# Not a title

Design  A:
\#O5445E - Navy Blue
\#189AB4 - Blue Grotto
\#75E6DA - Blue Green
\#D4F1F4 - Baby Blue

Design  B:
\#F4F4F4 - White Smoke
\#3575D4 - Windows Blue
\#4991FD - Dark Sky Blue

The reason with i have chosen blue is because its more calming, inspire of being trustworthy and having reliability. For A and B.
it draws people showing that the company is confident on selling phones.

#### fonts 

I am using AirStrike font from dafont for my title because it can attracts people's attention.

I am using Coolvetica font from dafont for my main text for my website because it will make it more readable for the users.
